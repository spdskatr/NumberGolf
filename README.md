# Number Golf

Submission for Grok Web.Comp 2019 Advanced stream

### How to play

Try to make the number shown on the screen using only the characters `1`, `+`, `*`, `(` and `)`. You are allowed to "concatenate" 2 numbers together, like 11 and 111, but addition and multiplication must be written out explicitly.
